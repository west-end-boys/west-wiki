# Agent Rules - Cross-Tool Compatible Instructions

> This file follows the AGENTS.md standard (agent-rules.org) for cross-tool compatibility.
> Works with: Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, VS Code AI, Zed, and other compatible tools.

## Test-Driven Development

All production code changes require a failing test first.

Process:
1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor with tests green
4. Commit

## Code Standards

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One change at a time
- Clear naming over comments
- Simple over clever
- Max 3 levels of nesting
- Functions do one thing
- No magic numbers

## Workflow

1. Read project docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, SPECS.md)
2. Create implementation plan in BUILD-TODO.md
3. Get approval before coding
4. For each task:
   - Create mini-plan in TASKLOG
   - Execute TDD cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
   - Quick review
   - Update TASKLOG + BUILD-TODO.md
   - Commit with conventional messages

## Communication

- Be direct and concise
- Ask when uncertain
- Report blockers immediately
- Provide honest feedback

## Git

- Conventional commits: type(scope): description
- Atomic commits
- Never commit failing tests
